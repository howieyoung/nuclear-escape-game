# Nuclear Crisis Simulator

A web-based simulation tool that helps users understand the potential impact of nuclear disasters in Taiwan, including radiation spread patterns and evacuation time windows.

## Features

- Interactive map interface
- Real-time radiation spread simulation
- Seasonal wind condition simulation
- Dynamic evacuation time calculation
- User location tracking
- Multiple nuclear plant locations

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 14
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Leaflet (for maps)
- Framer Motion (for animations)
- Zustand (for state management)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nuclear-escape-game.git
cd nuclear-escape-game
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## How to Play

1. Click "Start Simulation" to begin
2. Click on any city to place a hypothetical nuclear plant
3. Click "Simulate Disaster" to see how radiation spreads
4. Watch as the radiation cloud expands and cities' escape windows count down
5. Reflect on the results and try different scenarios

## Development

- Node.js 18.0.0 or later
- npm 9.0.0 or later

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
